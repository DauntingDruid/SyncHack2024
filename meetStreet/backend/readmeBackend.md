To better understand the `run.py` script in the backend of the `meetStreet` project, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your system.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where the `run.py` file is located. For example, if the file is located at `/Users/abhishektomar/Desktop/synchack 2024/SyncHack2024/meetStreet/backend`, use the `cd` command to navigate to that directory.
4. Once you are in the correct directory, run the following command to execute the `run.py` script:

    ```bash
    python3 run.py
    ```

    This command will start the backend server and allow you to interact with the `meetStreet` project.

Make sure to install any required dependencies before running the script. You can find more information about the project and its dependencies in the project's documentation.
